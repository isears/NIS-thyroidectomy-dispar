Design decisions:
- Using codes in grey-ed out column 
- Because ICD9 anastomosis codes are not specific for lap vs open, it's assume that if the original procedure was laparoscopic / open, then the anastomosis was the same
- Defined prolonged LOS as LOS > 10 (days)
- For the expanded inclusion criteria "procedure-only" codes were included only if there were no anastomosis codes also

TODOs:
- Fig1 needs both diagnoses and procedures
