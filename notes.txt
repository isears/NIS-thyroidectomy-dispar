Design decisions:
- Not using codes in grey-ed out column 
- Because ICD9 anastomosis codes are not specific for lap vs open, it's assume that if the original procedure was laparoscopic / open, then the anastomosis was the same
- Defined prolonged LOS as LOS > 10 (days)

TODOs:
- Re-vamped inclusion criteria but still have to run
- At some point need to re-run firstPassFilter. Changes shouldn't have made a difference but need to make sure
- Need to make sure lap / open proc and anastomosis codes match the V2 document
- Seem to be missing some ICD10 codes for procedures, anastomosis, and / or diagnoses of interest
- Figure 1 needs to revamped (see specific requirements in V2 document)
